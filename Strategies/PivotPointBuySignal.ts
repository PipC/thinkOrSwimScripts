# PocketPivot

# Identifies up-day volume spikes that may be a buyable pocket pivot.  Based on the

# This study checks price and volume to see if they met the pocket pivot
# criteria. The other criteria (strong fundamentals, no wedging, constructive
# basing, etc.) need to be evaluated separately. 
#
# I made these additions/modifications to Gil's and Chris's vague and sometimes
# conflicting definition of a pocket pivot:
#
# 1. Per Gil and Chris, the volume on the day of the pocket pivot must be
#    higher than any down day in the previous 10 days.  But if the volume is 
#    "choppy", then increase the period to 11 to 15 days.  But they don't 
#    define "choppy".  For the purposes of this script, I define choppy when 
#    the standard deviation of the volume is > 125% of the average.  Update: I
#    removed the stddev logic since it didn't eliminate any obviously poor
#    pivots.  I'm always looking at the volume on the previous 10 days.
#
# 2. I only count the pocket pivot if the stock closes in the upper 62% of the 
#    day's price range.  Up days that close lower in the range are considered
#    stalling.
# 
# 3. Gil and Chris say daily price closes prior to the pivot should be "tight" 
#    without any specifics.  I defined tight as where the average percent price
#    change at close over the last 10 days is <= 1.5%. Update: I removed this 
#    rule after backtesting against Gil's examples.
# 
# 4. Gil and Chris have examples of pocket pivots off of the 50-day instead of
#    the 10-day.  At that point the stock is extended from the 10-day.  That
#    seems to conflict with the idea that a pocket pivot occurs after a quiet
#    period in the stock so I have not implemented rules for 50-day PPs here.
#
# 5. The low on the day of the pivot must be within 1.4% of the 10-day SMA or
#    the price must have moved up through the 10-day during that day.  Several
#    of Gil/Chris's examples conflict. (Example: 1.24 in one example is
#    described as too extended, but there are others where 1.6 or even 2.5%
#    above the 10-day SMA isn't too extended.  In the Trading Cockpit with the
#    O'Neil Disciples, Chapter 5.) I'm choosing to use a middle and slightly
#    conservative setting here.  The more extended, the more risky the buy.
#
# 6. Pocket pivots should not be bought when then stock is below the 50- or
#    200-day simple moving averages. I check only the 50-day here because when
#    I checked the 200-day, TOS was hiding the study for recent IPOs with less
#    than 200 days of price history.
